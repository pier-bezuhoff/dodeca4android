# TODO
- [ ] ISSUE: DDUChooserActivity.kt/DDUAdapter/init may lead to OutOfMemoryError (fast return to after opening a ddu)
- [ ] new ddus <= Version -> shared preference
- [ ] skip n: in separate thread + optimize
- [ ] upd CirclesGroup (what?)
- [ ] outer open folder implicit intent?
- [ ] see ddu_files/ExampleSpirales: global 4, 4; no rules! but DodecaLook is playing them! knots?
- [ ] On small phones: expand/collapse for circle group often overlaps with its name (check PLR: K3 2017)
- [ ] import/export dir somehow (< 5.0 (KitKat))
- [ ] Save -> save as
- [ ] file name -> relative path in db
- [ ] factor * scale ~ 1 => fit screen ~~autocenter~~
- [ ] Rotate shapes (sq, hb, vb; with canvas.withRotation(...))
- [ ] Arcs (with rotation)
- [ ] On small screen: chosen shape is either *very* small or not shown at all (pre-launch reports)
- [ ] For release: disable Log.i-s?/
- [ ] Knot (see C++)
- [ ] Google Play: promotional video
- [ ] 'Brush' (see C++)
