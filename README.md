# TODO
- [ ] Bottom bar: on phone not all buttons are visible! Make 2 rows.
- [ ] Best center: works improper (screen rotation)

- [ ] Google Play: squares, unknown, promotional video
- [ ] values/defaults.xml for preferences default
- [ ] Do not retrace on language change
- [ ] Bottom bar descriptions don't work on Fedor's phone
