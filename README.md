# TODO
- [ ] Dodeca -> DodecaLook
- [ ] Best center: works improper (screen rotation)
- [ ] values/defaults.xml for preferences default
- [ ] Add preference speed: batch circle update
- [ ] Do not retrace on language change
- [ ] Separate folders for flavours (demo/full) and maybe build types (release/debug)
- [ ] Bottom bar: on phone not all buttons are visible!
- [ ] Increase bottom bar button size
- [ ] Bottom bar descriptions don't work on Fedor's phone
- [ ] More flexible icons for bottom bar
- [ ] Autorotate screen in settings (Note: when in settings/help screen rotation works well, maybe just write it in help), check rotation to tranlatate for best center
- [ ] Also see com.android.support:palette-v7:28.0.0
- [ ] Change color (choose from palette on ?double? tap) and save it for further changing
- [ ] For release: disable Log.i-s?/
- [ ] Update circles in other thread (see Log for b3/b4)
- [ ] Rotate shapes (i guess, with canvas.withRotation(...))
