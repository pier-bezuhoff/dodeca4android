- [ ] action bar: import/export

- [ ] Change color (choose from palette on ?double? tap) and save it for further changing
- [ ] Also see com.android.support:palette-v7:28.0.0
- [ ] On small screen: chosen shape is either *very* small or not shown at all (pre-launch reports)
- [ ] Strange bug on Android <= 5.1: 180605_1b (tunnel): lines instead of big-radius circles (?too big doubles?)
- [ ] For release: disable Log.i-s?/
- [ ] Knot (see C++)
