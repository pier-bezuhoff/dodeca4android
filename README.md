# Dodeca for Android
...
# TODO
- [ ] Icon
- [ ] Help
- [ ] When file schema: check new permission dispatcher + add translations
- [ ] Increase bottom bar button size
- [ ] Hide bottom bar after 30s -> settings
- [ ] Open file with Dodeca on click (is it possible for custom ext), override recent ddu and treat .ddu and .DDU as one!
- [ ] Different shapes for different circles, add shape map or global shape to ddu globals
- [ ] Rotate shape while motion: fix a point on circle when inverting or invert vector instead of circle
- [ ] Shared preference: recent ddu file
- [ ] Setting: always autocenter
- [ ] Extend trace bitmap (x 4) (fix it now)
- [ ] Change color (choose from palette on ?double? tap) and save it for further changing
- [ ] 'Brush' (see C++)
- [ ] 'Fill' (all?, see C++)
- [ ] Fix scaling (when redrawTraceOnMove it's obviously broken)
- [ ] Knot?
- [ ] Allow UPS > FPS (skipping some or smth other), remove FPS from settings

- [ ] Mode for dragging circles and changing radius
- [ ] Editing
