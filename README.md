# TODO
- [ ] Help
- [ ] Increase bottom bar button size
- [ ] More flexible icons for bottom bar
- [ ] Hide bottom bar after 30s -> settings
- [ ] Also see com.android.support:palette-v7:28.0.0
- [ ] Change color (choose from palette on ?double? tap) and save it for further changing
- [ ] Update circles in other thread (see Log for b3/b4)
- [ ] Rotate square
- [ ] Ugly log error: "Rejecting re-init on previously-failed class java.lang.Class<androidx.core.view.ViewCompat$OnUnhandledKeyEventListenerWrapper>: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Failed resolution of: Landroid/view/View$OnUnhandledKeyEventListener;"
- [ ] Addtional bottom bar control: stop, step back
- [ ] Focusing mode: following specific circle
- [ ] Store shape in ddu
- [ ] Different shapes for different circles, add shape map or global shape to ddu globals
- [ ] Extend trace bitmap (x 4) (fix it now)
- [ ] 'Brush' (see C++)
- [ ] 'Fill' (all?, see C++)
- [ ] Fix scaling (when redrawTraceOnMove it's obviously broken)
- [ ] Knot?
- [ ] Allow UPS > FPS (skipping some or smth other), remove FPS from settings
- [ ] I wish I could inline some annotation-based property marking, TemplateHaskell~
