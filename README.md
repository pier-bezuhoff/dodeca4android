# TODO
- [ ] Extract from MainActivity dodeca-specific part (like bottom bar, etc.)
- [ ] Progress bar on: db requests (or LiveData), restore all ddus, import/export folder
- [ ] temporaryPause does not work
- [ ] DduChooser: better animation when duplicate/rename/delete
- [ ] Not infinite zoom! Ex: growing-triton.ddu
- [ ] Navigation
- [ ] unit & instrumentation tests!
- [ ] check CirclesGroup without inline
- [ ] ddu -> gif?
- [ ] outer open folder implicit intent?
- [ ] see ddu_files/ExampleSpirales: global 4, 4; no rules! but DodecaLook is playing them! knots?
- [ ] file name -> relative path in db
- [ ] factor * scale ~ 1 => fit screen ~~autocenter~~
- [ ] Rotate shapes (sq, hb, vb; with canvas.withRotation(...))
- [ ] Arcs (with rotation)
- [ ] On small screen: chosen shape is either *very* small or not shown at all (pre-launch reports)
- [ ] For release: disable Log.i-s?
- [ ] Knot (see C++)
