# TODO
- [ ] Ddu preview
- [ ] circle: borderColor, fillColor
- [ ] Change color (choose from palette on ?double? tap) and save it for further changing
- [ ] values/defaults.xml for preferences default
- [ ] Maybe: use [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel#kotlin) for Trace.Bitmap
- [ ] Also see com.android.support:palette-v7:28.0.0
- [ ] Strange bug on Mama's phone: 180605_1b (tunnel): lines (?too big doubles?)
- [ ] For release: disable Log.i-s?/
- [ ] Rotate shapes (i guess, with canvas.withRotation(...))
- [ ] Google Play: promotional video
- [ ] Focusing mode: following specific circle
- [ ] 'Brush' (see C++)
